# TypeScript Documentation Rules (STRICT MODE)

## PURPOSE

Generate deterministic, AI-optimized documentation.

Output must:

* Be concise
* Follow exact section order
* Use required table formats
* Contain no narrative text
* Contain no stylistic variation
* Contain no redundant wording

Deviation from format is not allowed.

---

# GLOBAL RULES

1. Use exact section headings defined below.
2. Sections must appear in the specified order.
3. Omit sections only if they have zero applicable items.
4. Use tables exactly as defined.
5. Each description must be exactly one sentence.
6. No multi-sentence descriptions.
7. No bullet lists unless explicitly allowed.
8. No examples unless explicitly requested.
9. No explanation of TypeScript basics.
10. No commentary outside defined sections.
11. No additional prose before or after documentation.
12. No emojis.
13. No marketing language.
14. No subjective wording.
15. No speculative commentary.

---

# REQUIRED SECTION ORDER

If present, sections must appear in this exact order:

1. Module Header (JSDoc block)
2. Constants
3. Enums
4. Types
5. Classes
6. Functions
7. Design Decisions
8. Extension Guidelines
9. Errors

No reordering allowed.

---

# 1. MODULE HEADER (MANDATORY)

Always include at top of file:

```ts
/**
 * @module <ExactFileNameWithoutExtension>
 * @description <Single sentence describing responsibility>
 * @stability stable | experimental | internal
 */
```

Rules:

* Description must be one sentence.
* No additional tags except:

  * @public
  * @internal
  * @deprecated
  * @extension-points (only if applicable)

If extensible:

```ts
 * @extension-points
 * - <Interface or type designed for extension>
 * - <Registration location>
```

No extra commentary allowed.

---

# 2. CONSTANTS

Include only exported constants.

Format:

```
### Constants

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|------------|
| CONST_NAME | Type | Single sentence description. |
```

Rules:

* No explanation of primitive types.
* Description must describe purpose, not value.
* One sentence only.

---

# 3. ENUMS

Include only exported enums.

Format:

```
### Enums

#### EnumName

| Value | Description |
|-------|------------|
| VALUE | Single sentence description. |
```

Rules:

* One sentence per value.
* If enum requires centralized handling, append:

```
Extension:
- New values must be handled in <ExactLocation>.
```

No additional text.

---

# 4. TYPES

Include only exported types and interfaces.

Format:

```
### Types

#### TypeName

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|------------|
| fieldName | Type | Single sentence description. |
```

Rules:

* Do not explain primitive types.
* Mention invariants only if critical.
* One sentence per field.
* If forward-compatible:

```
Extension:
- Additional optional fields must remain backward compatible.
```

No extra text.

---

# 5. CLASSES

Format:

```
### Classes

#### ClassName

Responsibility: Single sentence description.

##### Methods

| Signature | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| methodName(arg: Type): ReturnType | Single sentence description. |
```

Rules:

* Use full method signature.
* No parameter breakdown.
* One sentence per method.
* Do not document private methods.

If non-obvious design:

```
Design Notes:
- Stateless | Stateful.
- Depends on <AbstractionName>.
```

Maximum two bullet points.

---

# 6. FUNCTIONS

Only exported functions.

Format:

```
### Functions

| Signature | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| function name(arg: Type): ReturnType | Single sentence description. |
```

Rules:

* Use full signature.
* No parameter descriptions.
* One sentence only.
* No examples.
* No multi-line descriptions.

If behavior is non-obvious:

```
Notes:
- <Design constraint>.
- <Error behavior if semantically important>.
```

Maximum two bullet points.

---

# 7. DESIGN DECISIONS

Include only if a non-obvious architectural decision exists.

Format:

```
### Design Decisions

Decision: Single sentence.
Reason: Single sentence.
Impact: Single sentence.
```

No additional commentary.

---

# 8. EXTENSION GUIDELINES

Include only if module is intentionally extensible.

Format:

```
### Extension Guidelines

- Add new implementations in <ExactDirectory>.
- Register new implementations in <ExactRegistryLocation>.
- Maintain backward compatibility of exported types.
```

Maximum three bullet points.
No additional text.

---

# 9. ERRORS

Only include if error semantics define system behavior.

Format:

```
### Errors

- Throws <ErrorType> when <Condition>.
- Returns null when <Condition>.
```

Maximum three bullet points.
One sentence per bullet.

---

# PROHIBITED CONTENT

The following must never be generated:

* Parameter-by-parameter explanation
* Tutorial-style explanation
* Code examples
* Inline comments explaining trivial logic
* Historical explanations
* Performance commentary unless critical
* Repetition of type information in prose
* Subjective language (e.g., "simple", "robust", "clean")

---

# LANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS

Descriptions must:

* Start with a verb in present tense.
* Avoid filler words.
* Avoid adjectives unless technically required.
* Be declarative.
* Be ≤ 20 words where possible.
* Never exceed 30 words.

---

# STRICT OUTPUT VALIDATION RULES

Before generating documentation, enforce:

* Section order is correct.
* No empty tables.
* No multi-sentence descriptions.
* No undocumented exported symbol.
* No undocumented exported enum value.
* No undocumented exported type field.
* No additional sections.
* No trailing commentary.

If a section has zero items, omit the section entirely.

---

# CURSOR EXECUTION DIRECTIVE

When generating documentation:

* Follow this specification exactly.
* Do not improvise structure.
* Do not expand descriptions.
* Do not change headings.
* Do not reorder sections.
* Do not add stylistic variations.
* Keep output compact and machine-readable.

Strict compliance is required.
